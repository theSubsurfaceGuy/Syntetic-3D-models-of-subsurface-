# Synthetic-3D-models-of-subsurface-
Developed mathematical models and workflow to automatically build diverse synthetic data sets with realistic folding and faulting patterns of earth layers . By optimizing machine learning models found UNET ( trained using the synthetic data set) outperformed the conventional approach of  mapping.
